# Java Practicals

### Description

This repository contains a collection of Java programs that cover various practical concepts. Each program is designed to demonstrate and practice specific Java features and techniques. Below is a brief overview of each program along with instructions on how to run them.

### Table of Contents

1) Converter
2) Fibonacci
3) InsertionSort
4) NumberPattern
5) SpiralProgram

### 1. Converter

The Converter program allows users to convert a given number to binary, octal, hexadecimal, or a custom base. Users can choose the desired conversion option and continue converting numbers as needed. The program includes input validation and exception handling to ensure a smooth user experience.

### 2. Fibonacci

The Fibonacci program generates a spiral pattern using Fibonacci sequence values. Users can specify the number of rows for the pattern, and the program ensures that the input is valid (odd and positive). The generated pattern includes both upper and lower halves of the diamond shape.

### 3. InsertionSort

The InsertionSort program implements the insertion sort algorithm for sorting a list of numbers. Users can input a series of numbers separated by spaces, and the program inserts and sorts them in ascending order. Additionally, users can add or remove numbers from the sorted list interactively.

### 4. NumberPattern

The NumberPattern program generates a pattern of numbers based on user input. It displays the pattern with proper spacing and allows the user to choose whether to continue or exit.

### 5. SpiralProgram

The SpiralProgram generates a spiral matrix of numbers based on user input. Users can define the size of the matrix and choose between a normal or reverse spiral. The program utilizes a matrix traversal algorithm to fill in the numbers in a spiral pattern. Users have the option to continue with a new matrix or exit the program.

### How to Run

Each program is contained in a separate Java file. You can compile and run the programs using a Java compiler and runtime environment. Follow these general steps:

1) Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2) Clone this repository to your local machine.
3) Navigate to the directory of the program you want to run.
4) Compile the Java file using 'javac FileName.java' .
5) Run the compiled program using 'java FileName' .

Feel free to explore, modify, and extend these programs according to your needs. Thank you for using this repository!
